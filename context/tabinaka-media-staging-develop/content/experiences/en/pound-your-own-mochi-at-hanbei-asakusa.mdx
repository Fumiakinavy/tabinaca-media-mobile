## Quick Overview

Turn warm steamed rice into soft, chewy mochi using a traditional wooden mallet. After a short English safety demo, you'll pound, shape, dress with classic toppings—and eat it while it's still warm. Family-friendly, photogenic, and delicious.

## What You'll Do

- **Welcome & safety** (3–5 min): stance, signals, how to swing
- **Pound the rice** (5–7 min): take turns; staff spots you
- **Shape & top** (10–15 min): bite-size mochi, sweet or savory
- **Taste & shoot** (10–15 min): enjoy on site; snap your keepsakes

## What's Included

- Steamed mochi rice (shared per booking)
- Toppings & sauces, plates/utensils, aprons/gloves
- English briefing and light supervision

## Perfect For

- Hands-on culture you can taste—quick, fun, and perfectly timed for a Shitamachi stroll
- Families with kids (age 7+ to swing the mallet; younger kids can help shape/taste)
- Anyone wanting a memorable, edible souvenir experience
