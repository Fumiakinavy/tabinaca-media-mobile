Sip your way through Japan's purest style of sake—junmai only—at a laid-back standing bar just 3 minutes from Shibuya Station. Choose the house tasting course (about 45 min; some days shown as 60 min) and sample from ~30 rotating bottles, with a simple English menu to guide you. Great for spontaneous plans and gap time before dinner.

## What You'll Do

- **Check in** at the counter and tell staff you'd like the tasting course (45 min). They'll hand you an English-friendly list with flavor notes
- **Explore junmai styles** at your own pace—ask for dry, fruity, rich, or funky—and compare regional bottles side by side. Selections change often, so it's always "一期一会" (one-time-only)
- **(Optional) Order small otsumami bites** to pair and try their fun soy-sauce bar to see how seasoning shifts a sip
- **Wrap up** with your favorite by-the-glass top-off, or head straight to dinner—Shibuya nightlife is on your doorstep
