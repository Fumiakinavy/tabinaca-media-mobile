## Quick Overview

Create a stylish herbarium bottle (or pendant) using real dried flowers in a calm studio just 5–8 minutes from Shibuya Station. Staff provide simple English guidance and all materials; you'll design, pour, seal, and take your piece home the same day. Open 10:00–18:00, with flexible start times.

## What You'll Do

- **Choose your bottle shape** or pendant frame and select dried flowers/leaves by color theme
- **Learn the basics** (composition tips, safety) and arrange your design
- **Pour clear herbarium oil**, seal, and label your creation
- **Snap photos** at the studio's "photo spot" before you leave (bag provided for carry-out)

- Use of tools and protective gear
- Basic English support from staff
- Same-day take-home with carry bag

## Perfect For

- Friends and couples wanting a pretty, light craft between shopping stops
- Solo travelers looking for a weather-proof, quick creative break
