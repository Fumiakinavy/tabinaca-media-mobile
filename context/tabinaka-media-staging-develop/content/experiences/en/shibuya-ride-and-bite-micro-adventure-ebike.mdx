## Quick Overview

Explore Shibuya by electric-assist bike in as little as 15 minutes. Pick up a bike near Shibuya Station, follow our map to rooftop parks, street art, and snack stops, then return the bike at any nearby HELLO CYCLING port. App-based unlock/return, flexible timing, and simple English briefing included. Most bikes are electric-assist for easy hills.

## What You'll Do

- **Check in (5 min)**: Our staff helps you open the HELLO CYCLING app, locate a nearby port, and show how to unlock/lock the bike. Basic EN support
- **Choose your time window & route**:
  - 15–30 min "Shibuya Snap Loop" — Scramble Crossing → Miyashita Park rooftop → Shibuya Stream riverside
  - 45–60 min "Creative Corridor" — Cat Street to Jingumae (design shops & cafés), optional coffee stop, loop back via Harajuku side streets
  - 75–90 min "Park & Pop Culture" — Detour to Yoyogi Park edge, back via Dogenzaka for neon & snacks
- **Return anywhere nearby**: Park at a HELLO CYCLING port, lock the bike, press RETURN on the handlebar terminal, and you're done

## What's Included

- On-site English orientation (how to rent/return, route tips)
- Digital route link (3 loops sized for 15/60/90 minutes)
- Safety card (left-side riding, sidewalk/helmet guidance)

**Not Included (pay-as-you-go via app):**
- Bike rental fees (pricing varies by port; commonly around ¥150–¥200 / 15 min, with longer caps or day rates often available in the ¥1,650–¥2,500 range)
- Food & drinks en route

## Perfect For

- Solo travelers, couples, and small groups wanting a fast, flexible snapshot of Shibuya's rooftops, lanes, and food alleys—without a guide

## Need-to-Know

- **Japan Bike Basics**: Ride on the left; follow signals and yield to pedestrians. Sidewalk riding is limited to signed/shared paths—go slow and be courteous
- **Helmets**: Since Apr 1, 2023, Japan has a "duty of effort" to wear a helmet for all ages (strongly recommended, some venues provide)
- **No alcohol riding**; no phone while riding
- Most HELLO CYCLING bikes are electric-assist; you can reserve a return port in the app before you ride
- **Meeting Point & Timing**: Meet near Shibuya Station (we'll direct you to the closest HELLO CYCLING port at check-in). Start times: On demand, daily 10:00–19:00 (last 90-min start 17:30). Duration choices: 15, 45–60, or 75–90 minutes (you choose on arrival)
- **Optional Add-Ons**: Helmet rental, Rain poncho set, Polaroid snapshot at Scramble Crossing (takeaway print)
