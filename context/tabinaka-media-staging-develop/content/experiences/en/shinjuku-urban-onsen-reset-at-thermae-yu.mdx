## Quick Overview

Slip into a 24/7 oasis in the heart of Shinjuku: Thermae-yu brings real hot-spring water from Nakaizu to its outdoor rotenburo and a full suite of indoor baths, including a high-concentration carbonated bath (1,100 ppm) and silky micro-bubble tubs. Two sauna types help you "totonou" fast. Towels and lounge wear are included.

## What You'll Do

- **Check in**, receive your locker key, towel set, and lounge wear; staff can give simple English guidance
- **Shower thoroughly** (no swimwear), then ease in: start outside in the natural hot spring rotenburo, then try the silky bath
- **Rotate recovery sets**: 8–10 min dry sauna → 1 min cool bath → 5–10 min rest; 10–12 min in carbonated bath
- **Re-hydrate**, change into lounge wear, and unwind in the relaxation areas

## What's Included

- Day admission with access to all standard baths & saunas
- Towel set and in-house lounge wear
- Shampoo, conditioner, body soap, dryers, and basic amenities
- Relaxation spaces on multiple floors

## Perfect For

- Travelers needing a fast, city-center reset before/after flights or meetings
- Sauna fans who want a reliable "totonou" with proper cold plunge & rest
- Couples or friends seeking a weather-proof wellness break near Kabukicho
