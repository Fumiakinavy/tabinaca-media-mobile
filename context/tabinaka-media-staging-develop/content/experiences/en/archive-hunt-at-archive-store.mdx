## Quick Overview

Descend to a museum-like basement boutique devoted to rare designer archives (think Margiela Artisanal, Raf Simons, Undercover "Scab," etc.). Curated like a gallery, but you can buy the pieces. Hours: Mon–Fri 15:00–20:00 / Sat–Sun 13:00–20:00. Address: B1F, Wako Bldg., 1-12-16 Jinnan, Shibuya-ku.

## What You'll Do

- **01 — Gallery Walk (10–15 min)**: Enter the minimalist B1F space and slow-walk the racks & vitrines like an exhibition. Skim labels and wall copy to spot decades, lines, and runway seasons
- **02 — "Decode the Tag" Challenge (10–20 min)**: Pick 2 items and identify season/line (e.g., Raf Simons AW03 "Closer", Maison Margiela Line 6/10/Artisanal). Staff will confirm if you're right
- **03 — Fit & Fabric Check (10–25 min)**: If trying on is allowed for the piece, do a gentle fit test (seams, lining, shoulder slope) and a light test (hold to light to see weave or repairs). Handle with care—many items are collectible
- **04 — Compare & Decide (10–15 min)**: Shortlist 1 item by story (runway/era), condition, and versatility. Snap reference photos only if permitted; some vitrines are "no touch/no photo."
- **05 — Archival Exit Shot (2 min)**: Exterior street-style photo with your pick; Jinnan's lanes give great texture

## What's Included

- A self-guided route; the shop team can answer basics (season, provenance) when available
- The store collects and sources archives globally, so inventory rotates—repeatable experience

## Perfect For

- Fashion travelers, stylists, and culture lovers who want a high-impact, short stop between Shibuya and Cat Street—and anyone keen to handle pieces you usually only see in books
