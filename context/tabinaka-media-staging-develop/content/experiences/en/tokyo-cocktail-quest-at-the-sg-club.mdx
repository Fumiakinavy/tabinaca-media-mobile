## Quick Overview

Sip your way through one of Asia's most-awarded cocktail bars in a playful, self-guided "quest." Start casual at Guzzle (street level), descend to Sip (basement) for refined signatures, and finish with a limited, upstairs stop at SANGAI if open. Staff can assist in basic English; walk-ins welcome.

## What You'll Do

- **Check in & pick your route**: Choose Casual → Classic (Guzzle → Sip) or vice versa
- **Order 1 "crushable" at Guzzle**: Think bright, easy-drinking signatures to warm up
- **Level up at Sip**: Head downstairs for a crafted, spirit-forward signature
- **Optional final boss: SANGAI**: If the third floor is open, pop up for a limited menu
- **Stamp your "quest"**: Ask for a receipt stamp/coaster from each floor for a keepsake photo

## What's Included

- Access to two distinct bars under one roof (Guzzle & Sip); non-smoking throughout
- Basic English support from bar staff (menu guidance, ordering)
- Not included: Drinks/food are à la carte

## Perfect For

- Cocktail lovers who want a top-tier, quick taste of Tokyo mixology
- Friends/couples seeking a flexible 45–90 min stop before dinner or after shopping
- Fans of award-winning bars (The SG Club is a regular on Asia's 50 Best Bars)
