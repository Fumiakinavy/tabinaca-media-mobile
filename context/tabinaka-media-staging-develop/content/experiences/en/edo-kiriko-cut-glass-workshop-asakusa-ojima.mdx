## Quick Overview

Carve your own Edo Kiriko glass at Asakusa Ojima. After a short English safety/demo briefing, you'll work hands-on at a diamond wheel to engrave classic Japanese patterns on a tumbler or paperweight. Take your finished piece home the same day.

## What You'll Do

- **Choose your base** (tumbler, small glass, or paperweight) and a pattern (e.g., asanoha hemp-leaf, shippo linked circles)
- **Staff explain tools & safety** in basic English (5–10 min)
- **Practice on a sample**, then self-carve at the wheel to cut facets and lines (45–70 min)
- **Rinse, inspect, and box** your piece for same-day take-home

## What's Included

- Diamond-wheel station & practice glass
- Safety gear (aprons, goggles)
- English demo & intermittent assistance
- Gift boxing for your finished piece

## Perfect For

- Travelers who want a make-and-take craft in 1–1.5 hours
- Couples/friends creating matching glasses
- Rainy-day, culture-rich activity near Sensō-ji
