## Quick Overview

Hit UNDEFEATED's two-floor Shibuya chapter on Cat Street for a fast, photogenic sneaker run. Time it for an 11:00 drop (typical start for launches) or do an off-peak scout. Staff can assist in basic English; the route below turns a store visit into a mini-experience. Address: S BLDG., 5-29-8 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku. Hours: 11:00–20:00 daily.

## What You'll Do

- **00:00–00:10 — Queue & Brief**: If it's a launch morning, join the line and check the @undefeated_japan post/story for that day's rules (first-come vs raffle, wristbands, SKU list). Doors usually open 11:00. Off-peak? Walk straight in
- **00:10–00:20 — Heat Wall Scan**: Do a full lap of the first floor: flag collabs & GRs you want hands-on. Ask staff for sizes; note fit on Nike/Adidas/New Balance pairs you care about
- **00:20–00:35 — Try-On & Lace Test**: Quick "fit audit": toe room, midfoot wrap, heel slip. Do 10-step walk on the rug; try a loose vs runner's knot to compare lockdown. Snap one mirror shot for later decision
- **00:35–00:45 — Apparel Sweep (2F)**: Head upstairs for tees, caps, accessories; check the five-strike logo colorways to match your pair. (The Shibuya shop has two floors of sneakers, clothing, accessories.)
- **00:45–00:60 — Decide & Check Out**: Pick 1 pair + 1 accessory (socks, cap, or cleaning kit). If it's a sell-out item, follow staff instructions for purchase flow
- **Extend to 90 min**: add a Cat Street sneaker loop (walkable) to KICKS LAB. / Supreme / NikeLab MA5 after checkout for comparisons and photos

## What's Included

- Self-guided route + store staff's basic English support for sizing and checkout
- Optional photo spots (mirror, logo wall) inside the chapter

## Perfect For

- Sneakerheads chasing drops, casual shoppers wanting a quick "Tokyo street" moment, creators needing content near Harajuku/Cat Street

## Need-to-Know

- **Location & Hours**: UNDEFEATED Shibuya, S BLDG., 5-29-8 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku. 11:00–20:00 daily
- **Drop timing**: Launch communications typically go live on @undefeated_japan; many in-store releases start 11:00. Details (first-come vs raffle) vary by product—always check the latest post
- **Etiquette**: Follow queue cones, no cutting; ask before filming staff; one size/one color per SKU limits may apply on drop days
- **Backup plan**: If a pair sells out, ask about restocks or check neighboring stops on the Cat Street loop
