## Quick Overview

Slip behind the "secret" gachapon entrance and settle into a cozy window perch at LOST, a traveler-friendly cocktail bar 5 minutes from Shibuya Scramble. In 30–60 minutes you'll discover one of Tokyo's most talked-about small bars, choose a LOST Signature (or a crafted mocktail), and capture a moody Shibuya shot from the bar's large windows. Walk-ins welcome; VIP room is reservable for small groups. Hours are Mon–Tue 18:00–23:00, Wed–Sun 15:00–23:00.

## What You'll Do

- **Unlock the entrance (2–3 min)**: Find the low-key door—locals love that it's tucked away and playfully "hidden," even noted by city guides as being behind a gachapon machine
- **Order your hero drink (5–10 min)**: Pick from house signatures like Too Much Volcano, Like a Magic Mule, Life Is Balloons, or go zero-proof with a bartender-made mocktail. (English menu; staff can recommend.)
- **Sip & shoot (15–30 min)**: Enjoy your drink while people-watching over Center-gai; grab a quick window photo—this is the classic LOST moment
- **Optional second round (10–15 min)**: Try a different signature or Japan-leaning pour (they often feature sake alongside cocktails)

## What's Included

- English-friendly bar team & menu
- Seating at the counter or tables (walk-in; first-come basis)
- Mocktails available for non-drinkers

## Perfect For

- Solo travelers or couples wanting a quick, atmospheric Shibuya stop
