## Quick Overview

Blast off on a short, self-guided space adventure in central Tokyo. TenQ combines an immersive "space theater" with hands-on science and play zones—great as a flexible 60–90 minute stop. English signage and staff support make it easy; you'll follow a simple mission card to explore, solve, and snap a few cosmic photos before rejoining your day.

## What You'll Do

- **Check in** and grab an English mission card or brief orientation from staff
- **Enter the immersive space theater** for a stunning, short presentation that sets your mission
- **Explore interactive galleries** at your own pace: try mini experiments, touch-and-try exhibits, and playful AR/photo spots
- **Complete quick challenges** (no prior knowledge needed) and collect mission "wins"
- **Wrap up** at the shop for astronaut-worthy souvenirs—or head straight back to Tokyo Dome City

## What's Included

- Timed entry to the space theater and all standard exhibition zones
- English basic guidance (signage/handout; staff can assist)
- Use of photo spots inside the galleries (non-flash; personal devices)

## Perfect For

- Families, couples, and friends looking for a fun, weather-proof science activity
- Space and STEM fans with only 1–1.5 hours to spare
- First-time Tokyo visitors who want a unique, central-city museum stop
- Content creators hunting for striking, futuristic visuals
