## Quick Overview

Drop into a calm, street-level gallery by Shibuya's Koen-dori and explore short, thought-provoking shows on inclusion, outsider art, and creative diversity. Entry is free, doors open 11:00–19:00, and it's an easy 8-minute walk from Hachikō.

## What You'll Do

- **2-Room Dash (10–20 min)**: Start at Gallery 1, then loop Gallery 2. Read one wall text fully and pick a single work that speaks to you—title it in your own words
- **Micro Reflection (5–10 min)**: In your notes app, finish the prompt: "Inclusion feels like…" using three adjectives you get from the works
- **Texture Hunt (10–15 min)**: Find three contrasting "materials or mark-making" (e.g., stitched cloth / thick paint / pencil line). Snap detail photos only where signage allows
- **Exit Share (5 min)**: Outside the entrance, take a keepsake photo of the Koen-dori side (no artworks in frame) and jot one sentence you'll remember

## What's Included

- Self-guided route with 3 mini-missions (above)
- English website pages for hours and access; on-site labels vary by exhibition

## Perfect For

- Solo travelers or pairs who want a quiet, meaningful 30–60 minute reset steps from Shibuya Crossing—no guide needed

## Need-to-Know

- **Hours/Closed days**: 11:00–19:00. Closed Mondays (open if Monday is a public holiday, then closed the next weekday) and during exhibition changeover
- **Admission**: Free
- **Access & Address**: 1F, Shibuya Workers' Welfare Hall, 1-19-8 Jinnan, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-0041 (about 8 minutes from JR Shibuya, Hachikō)
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair lift at the Koen-dori entrance; ring the intercom for staff assistance (a quick call ahead helps)
- **Right now / upcoming**: Check the gallery site or Tokyo Art Beat for the current show; the venue lists an exhibition cycle with an upcoming program from Sep 27–Dec 21, 2025
