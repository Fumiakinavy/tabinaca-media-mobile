## Quick Overview

Step into a 1920s classical-music kissaten where conversation and photography are off-limits. Order one drink, face the 3-meter wooden speakers, and soak in a curated program (or request a piece outside concert times). A uniquely Japanese, meditative break just off Dogenzaka.

## What You'll Do

- **Enter quietly**; purchase one drink (coffee typically around ¥650)
- **Choose a seat** facing the giant horn speakers and listen in silence
- **Time your visit** to a daily "Lion Concert" (approx. 1 hour) around 3:00 pm or 7:00 pm
- **Unwind** for 30–60 minutes; writing/reading is welcome, chatting and phone calls are not

## What's Included

- Seat in a historic, two-floor hall built to listen (no guide needed)
- Access to a vast classical collection; daily set programs

## Perfect For

- Travelers seeking a uniquely Japanese, screen-free reset between Shibuya sights
- Music lovers who want to experience classical records on a grand, vintage system
- Solo visitors, couples, small groups comfortable with a silent space
