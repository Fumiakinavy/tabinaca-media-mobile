## Quick Overview

Slide into Shibuya's backstreets and sample world-class craft beer at Mikkeller Tokyo. Choose a few small pours from 20 constantly rotating taps, sip by the street-facing counter or head upstairs to a quieter lounge, and (optionally) pair with Danish-inspired snacks. English-friendly setup; walk-ins welcome.

- **Build your own "mini flight"** by ordering several small glasses (they offer small or pint sizes)
- **Grab an open-window seat** downstairs to people-watch, or move upstairs to relax with friends
- **(Optional) Add Danish-inspired** open-faced sandwiches/snacks to match your beers

## What's Included

- Pay-as-you-go drinks (small glass or pint) and access to two floors with different vibes
