## Quick Overview

Step into a retro yokocho-style bar where all-you-can-eat Japanese penny snacks (dagashi) meet playful cocktails. Build your own candy flight, pair it with a drink, and soak up Showa-era vibes just off Center-gai. Walk-in friendly; evenings can be busy.

## What You'll Do

- **Grab a basket** and pick from rows of nostalgic dagashi (think Umaibō, ramune tablets, gummies)
- **Order a drink** (soft drink, beer, highball; fun originals available) and create your own candy & drink pairing
- **Try a "retro cafeteria" side** (like fried age-pan or napolitan spaghetti) to balance the sweets
- **Snap photos** under lanterns and old-school signs—pure time-travel energy
- **Optional**: make it a mini tasting—rank your top 5 dagashi before you leave

## What's Included

- Seating in a retro bar space
- Unlimited dagashi when you choose a set/course (drink plan options available)

## Perfect For

- Friends night or quirky date near Shibuya Crossing
- Sweet tooth travelers keen to sample "everyday Japan" snacks
- Rainy-day, low-effort fun between shopping and bar-hopping
