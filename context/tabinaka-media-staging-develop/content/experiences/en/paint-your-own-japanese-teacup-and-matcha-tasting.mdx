## Quick Overview

Design and paint a Japanese yunomi (teacup) or small plate, then enjoy a calming bowl of matcha while your piece is prepared for kiln firing. Staff give a brief English intro to tools, motifs, and glazing basics; the creative work is self-paced. Finished ceramics are kiln-fired and can be picked up later or shipped overseas.

## What You'll Do

- **Choose your base**: yunomi teacup or small dessert plate
- **Learn simple Japanese patterns** (seigaiha waves, asanoha hemp leaves) and underglaze tips in a short English briefing
- **Sketch, paint, and personalize**—add a date or name on the underside
- **Take a tea break**: whisk and sip matcha (or sencha) while you admire your work
- **Leave your piece** for kiln firing (about 2–3 weeks); opt for pickup or international shipping

## What's Included

- 1 bisque item (teacup or small plate) and all paints/brushes
- Apron and simple stencil sheets for traditional motifs
- Basic English support from staff (tools, safety, design ideas)
- One serving of matcha (or sencha) with sweets
- Kiln firing and protective packaging (shipping optional)

## Perfect For

- Travelers wanting a compact, creative keepsake in under 90 minutes
- Couples, friends, families (ages 6+ recommended)
- Rainy-day plans and calm breaks between Shibuya/Harajuku sightseeing
