## Quick Overview

Slip one minute off Shibuya Crossing into an 8th-floor "library where you can drink, eat, and talk." Ring the doorbell, step into calm shelves, order a drink, and sink into a quiet, bookish bubble—open roughly 09:00–22:45 near Hachikō. Reservations are welcome.

- **Order & browse (15–60 min)**: Grab a coffee/tea from the café counter and wander staff-curated shelves in this "talking-OK" library. Power outlets hide in the bookcases—perfect for a journaling break
- **Leave a trace (5 min)**: Jot a short note or favorite line and share it with staff—your mini-review may get posted in-house
