- **Settle in**: connect to fast Wi-Fi, plug in devices, and make the space your mini office, cinema, or nap pod
- **Help yourself** to the free drink bar and unlimited soft-serve between tasks or scenes; bring your own snacks if you prefer
- **Optional add-ons (on the spot)**: take a 10–20 min shower—amenities provided—or upgrade to a larger room if one is free
