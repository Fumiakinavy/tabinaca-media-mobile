## Shibuya at a Glance: Your Visual Orientation

Shibuya is a sprawling, energetic district, but understanding its layout is simpler than you think. Think of it as a central hub (Shibuya Station and the Scramble Crossing) with distinct areas radiating outwards, each offering a unique flavor of Tokyo.

At the very heart of Shibuya lies Shibuya Station, one of Tokyo's busiest transportation hubs. Just outside its Hachiko Exit is the world-famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, an iconic symbol of Tokyo's urban energy. This is your primary entry point and a natural starting point for any exploration [1].

- **Key Landmark:** Shibuya Scramble Crossing, Hachiko Statue
- **Visual Cue:** The massive intersection where thousands cross simultaneously from multiple directions
- **Navigation Tip:** The Hachiko Exit is your gateway to the crossing and statue. Use overhead walkways or nearby buildings (like Shibuya Scramble Square) for panoramic views.
